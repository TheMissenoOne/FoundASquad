# FoundASquad
FoundASquad is an online platform developed as the final project for the Informatics Technical Course at ETEC Doutora Ruth Cardoso that aims to help players join teams easily and efficiently, reducing frustration caused by poorly formed teams and providing a more satisfying experience for players. 

With few solutions available in the market for forming teams in electronic games, poorly formed teams are one of the main reasons for frustration among players. Upon registering on the platform, players can create profiles and specify their games and skills, allowing them to search for other players with complementary abilities or join existing teams. The platform also includes features such as group chat and integration with other gaming platforms to help manage teams.
